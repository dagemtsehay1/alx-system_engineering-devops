# Commandline Challenge

For this project, I completed the [Commandline Challenge](https://cmdchallenge.com). Each file is a PNG screenshot signifying my completion of all levels.

## What is Commandline Challenge?

The Commandline (CMD) CHALLENGE Directed Project is a cool game that challenges you in `Bash` skills. Everything is done through the command line and the questions are getting more complicated. It's a good workout to improve skills on the command line!
